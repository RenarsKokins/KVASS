# KVASS - firmware for my split keyboard

Built for ESP32-S3 chips, acts as a keyboard which sends keystrokes and pointer device data to connected device (acts as HID). It is possible to connect to host devices using USB and Bluetooth, optionally ESP-NOW if you have a third ESP device with ESP-NOW functionality.
